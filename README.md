## Vidjot

This project is to enhance my knowledge about NodeJS and especially Express then Passport (for authentication). 

It's basically a CRUD app, based on the Udemy [course](https://www.udemy.com/nodejs-express-mongodb-dev-to-deployment/) of Brad Traversy.

You can access a live version of the app at : https://vvidjot.herokuapp.com/ideas

To test you can use the following account (note the inspiration... :relieved: ) : 

`some.email@gmail.com:1234`

`another.email@gmail.com:1234`

What I've learned so far : 
- Creating model with Mongoose
- Build a CRUD app with Express
- Use of Passport to restrict access
- Use of Handlebars as a template engine to render view at the server side
- Deploy to heroku

Even if the code will be pretty similar as the one he wrote, I can assure that mine is not copy/paste, the goal is to be confident with the tech, not give the illusion of. (for example, I use async/await rather than then/catch for Promise resolution)
