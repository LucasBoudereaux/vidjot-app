## Vidjot

This project is to enhance my knowledge about NodeJS and especially Express then Passport (for authentication). 

It's basically a CRUD app, based on the Udemy [course](https://www.udemy.com/nodejs-express-mongodb-dev-to-deployment/) of Brad Traversy.

Even if the code will be pretty similar as the one he wrote, I can assure that mine is not copy/paste, the goal is to be confident with the tech, not give the illusion of. (for example, I use async/await rather than then/catch for Promise resolution)
